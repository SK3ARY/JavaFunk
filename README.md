# JavaFunk
My rendition of the BrainFuck compiler, coded entirely in Java.

## Syntax
* `+` increments current cell
* `-` decrements current cell
* `>` increments pointer
* `<` decrements pointer
* `.` prints value of cell (as ascii character)
* `,` gets user input
* `[` loop start
* `]` if current cell value is larger than 0, set pointer to closest `[`
